# Constitution (Non-Negotiables)
- Specs are the source of truth; code implements specs; code is never the spec.
- Behavioral changes require spec/plan/tasks updates (before or with code).
- Local quality gates must pass: format, lint, tests (and schema/docs if applicable).
- Reviews are spec-driven; findings are actionable (BLOCKER/MAJOR/MINOR).
